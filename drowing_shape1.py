# In this code, we are going to draw shapes on an image and create a blank image.

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Create a blank image using NumPy
# `np.zeros()` creates an array filled with zeros, which represents a black image.
# The shape (500, 500, 3) means the image has a height and width of 500 pixels, 
# and 3 color channels (for RGB).
# `dtype="uint8"` specifies the data type for pixel values, where uint8 (unsigned 8-bit integer) is standard for images.
blank = np.zeros((500, 500, 3), dtype="uint8")  

# Display the blank (black) image
cv2.imshow("Blank", blank)  

# Step 2: Fill the blank image with a specific color (Green in this case)
# `blank[:] = 0, 255, 0` sets all pixels in the image to the color Green.
# The format is BGR (Blue, Green, Red), where (0, 255, 0) means maximum Green, no Red, and no Blue.
blank[:] = 0, 255, 0  
cv2.imshow("Green", blank)  

# Step 3: Draw a smaller square of Blue color on the green image
# `blank[200:300, 300:400] = 255, 0, 0` changes the pixel values in the region
# defined by rows 200-300 and columns 300-400 to Blue.
# This creates a square of Blue color within the larger Green area.
blank[200:300, 300:400] = 255, 0, 0  
cv2.imshow("Blue", blank)  

# Step 4: Fill the entire image with Red color
# `blank[:] = 0, 0, 225` changes all pixels to Red.
# The BGR format (0, 0, 225) represents maximum Red, no Green, and no Blue.
blank[:] = 0, 0, 225  
cv2.imshow("Red", blank)  

# Step 5: Experiment with custom colors
# `blank[:] = 100, 100, 100` sets the entire image to a custom grayish color.
# You can use this technique to create any color by adjusting the BGR values.
blank[:] = 100, 100, 100  
cv2.imshow("Mix", blank)
